##  **I love Horror**

### my favourite series :
1. The last of us.
2. From.
3. The walking dead.
 
 #### **"unique"** is an adjective used to describe something that is one of a kind, singular, or the only one of its kind. It means that there is no other exactly like it, making it distinct, unusual, or unparalleled in some way.
